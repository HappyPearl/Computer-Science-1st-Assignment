Q: Write a program that translates a grade, expressed in letters, entered
by the user into the corresponding numerical grade and prints it. The letter grades are 'A', 'B',
'C', 'D' and 'F', possibly followed by a + or – sign. Their numerical values are, in order, 4.0,
3.0, 2.0, 1.0 and 0.0. The grades 'F+' and 'F–' do not exist. A + sign increases the numerical
grade by 0.3, while a – sign decreases it by the same amount. The grade 'A+' is still equal to 4.0.
